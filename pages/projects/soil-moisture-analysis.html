                    Surface soil moisture (SSM), depths of 3–5 cm, data is vital for crop yield estimation, drought monitoring, irrigation management, and urban water planning. This project addresses critical gaps in global soil moisture monitoring through innovative machine learning approaches.
                </p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    Surface soil moisture data represents a valuable input for food security, famine early warning system networks, as well as food action collaborative programs such as Food for Humanity Initiative (F4Hi), which is designed to support interdisciplinary research on healthy and sustainable food systems. Satellite-based soil moisture retrieval has advanced significantly in recent years through missions like the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, no truly coherent, comprehensive global soil moisture database with systematic quality control exists. This challenge is even more pronounced for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM), depths of 30–110 cm, which traditionally requires ground-based measurements that are far too sparse to calculate RZSM at global- or even regional-scales.
                </p>

                <h2>Methodology: Two-Phase Approach</h2>
                <h3>Phase 1: Machine Learning Gap-Filling</h3>
                <p>
                    We apply spatio-temporal machine learning (ML) techniques to interpolate data gaps in daily soil moisture products from satellite missions like SMAP, creating continuous global coverage. This ML approach is particularly well-suited for hydrologic applications characterized by high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, as ML methods can better capture complex nonlinear relationships in heterogeneous systems compared to traditional process-based or physical models.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 2: Physics-Based Data Assimilation</h3>
                <p>
                    We employ these enhanced SSM datasets as initial conditions for estimating RZSM profiles using Reduced-Order Variational Data Assimilation. This phase leverages physics-based simulation to couple the assimilation of SSM data from the first phase, yielding more accurate estimates of soil moisture profiles at global scale.
                </p>

                <h2>Expected Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    This research promises transformative benefits across multiple sectors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Enhanced crop yield forecasting and efficient irrigation scheduling, directly supporting global food security efforts in vulnerable regions</li>
                    <li><strong>Disaster Management:</strong> Strengthened early warning systems for droughts and floods, potentially saving lives and reducing economic losses</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Science:</strong> More accurate land-surface modeling, improving understanding of water and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere</li>
                </ul>
