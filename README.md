## About This Project

My website is designed to showcase my expertise through various sections:

* **Publications:** A record of my published research papers and academic contributions in journals such as *Water Resources Research*, *Journal of Hydroinformatics*, *Waste Management*, and others.  
* **Projects:** Detailed case studies and descriptions of my key projects, including:
  - **Atmospheric Composition Emulation** – developing machine learning frameworks to emulate atmospheric tracers in NASA GISS ModelE.  
  - **Stochastic Flood Mapping** – vision-based frameworks for flood detection and streamflow estimation.  
  - **Fire Model Reinsurance** – integrating machine learning with climate extremes for risk assessment.  
  - **Soil Moisture Monitoring** – global-scale ML-based prediction of surface soil moisture.  
* **Blog:** A space where I share reflections on research, teaching, and emerging topics such as the expressivity, inductive bias, and interpretability of machine learning models in Earth sciences.  

This is a living project that I continually update with new research and insights.
